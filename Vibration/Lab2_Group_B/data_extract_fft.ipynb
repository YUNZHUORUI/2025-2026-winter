    "What is done in the next cell with the function `plotspec` is certainly not the most efficient and correct way of doing spectrum analysis on measured vibration data, for, amongst others, the following reasons:\n",
    "- No anti-aliasing filtering was employed before sampling the data.  When aliasing happens, the spectrum is contaminated below half the sampling frequency by whatever happens above half the sampling frequency.  To prevent aliasing, a high quality (as not to distort the phase information) analogue low pass filter must be employed before sampling the analogue signal, to remove any content above half the sampling frequency.  Our sampling frequency is about 50 Hz.  I am fairly confident that we do not have significant content in our acceleration signals above half the sampling frequency (25 Hz).\n",
    "- The spectra should really be calculated through averaging a number of FFT results, employing power and cross spectra.  This is not done here.  Instead, we shall consider a single FFT of a single time window of data for each channel and use this to draw conclusions.  In this experiment this procedure works well enough to be used.\n",
